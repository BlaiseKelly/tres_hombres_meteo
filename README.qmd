# Introduction

The Tres Hombres is the only engineless cargo ship in the world.

During the year it undertakes numerous trips around the world carrying high values cargo such as cocoa, rum, wine and olive oil from producers to markets. I travelled on one such trip this summer. The meteo data onboard was limited and I was curious to retrospectively analyse the conditions, where the boat was, but also surrounding. Such data is readily available for anyone and could be used to improve the efficiency and safety of voyages.

The route looked like this:

```{r schools, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=FALSE, cache=FALSE, results=FALSE, error=FALSE}

track_buffer <- st_transform(st_buffer(st_transform(track_sf,28992), 10000),4326)

bg <- basemap_raster(ext=track_buffer, map_service = "carto", map_type = "light")

tm_shape(bg)+
  tm_rgb()+
  tm_shape(track_sf)+
  tm_dots(col = 'orange', size = 0.7,title = "Tres Hombres", legend.show = TRUE)

```
This repository includes the gpx file recorded on my watch every 15 minutes (whilst on deck). The coordinates are imported from this in script 01_download_data.R and used to download data for 8 parameters I thought would be interesting:

 - 10m_u_component_of_wind  
 - 10m_v_component_of_wind  
 - 2m_temperature  
 - sea_surface_temperature  
 - total_precipitation  
 - surface_solar_radiation_downwards  
 - mean_direction_of_total_swell  
 - k_index  
 
from the ECMWF Climate data store (cds). This is free for anyone to use but requires an account to be created. Once you have an account, get the API and paste it into the function get_era.

02_plot_meteo.R imports this data and creates pngs for each hour and variable 
03_write_movie.R arranges these on the screen and writes a few frames
04_stitch_movie.R compiles the seperate mp4 files into a single file
